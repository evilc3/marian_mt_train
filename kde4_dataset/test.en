In & kguitar; tabulature editor, the most basic unit of a song is a single column. Column is a group of notes (or rests) that begin at the same time (well, almost, there's an exception to this rule if tabulature effects are used) and have same duration (there're also some exceptions). Such notes (and corresponding fret numbers for them) are vertically aligned and form a single column of tabulature.

When configuring an alarm, you can choose whether it should repeat, and whether the alarm should be canceled if it cannot be triggered at its scheduled time. For display alarms, you can type in a message text, specify a text or image file to display, or specify a command whose output should be displayed. You can also choose the color of the alarm message, and whether to play a sound or speak the message.
Please insert the command used to encode the audio data. The command has to read raw little endian (see Swap Byte Order) 16-bit stereo audio frames from stdin. The following strings will be replaced by K3b: %f - The filename of the resulting file. This is where the command has to write its output to. The following refer to metadata stored for example in the ID3 tag of an mp3 file (Be aware that these values might be empty). %t - Title %a - Artist %c - Comment %n - Track number %m - Album Title %r - Album Artist %x - Album comment %y - Release Year

Mathematicians calculate that a 3x3x3 cube can be shuffled into 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different patterns, yet they conjecture that all positions can be solved in 20 moves or less. The method that can do that (as yet undiscovered) is called God's Algorithm. Many longer methods are known. See the two Wikipedia articles on Rubik's Cube and Optimal Solutions for Rubik's Cube. Several methods work systematically by building the solution one layer at a time, using sequences of moves that solve a few pieces without disturbing what has already been done. The'Beginner Solution 'demonstrated here uses that approach. Just over 100 moves solve a cube that is shuffled in 20.

We have released & quantaplus; 3.4 and are now in preparation for the next major release. The targeted 4.0 release is a partial rewrite of Quanta to use the features offered by the KDevelop framework. Our objective remains to create the very best web development environment. We realize that we will need many more people actively developing & quantaplus; to accomplish this, so we are in the process of developing enhancements geared toward making it easy for web developers to customize, extend, and enhance & quantaplus;. Much of this has been accomplished with the 3.4 release. Soon will be asking you, the web developers, to contribute your feature enhancements. We will organize these so that & quantaplus; web developers can find just the resources, extensions, and custom plug-ins they need to be the most reliable, professional developers ever!

By default, & kstars; will read in the options values stored in your $KDEHOME/ share/ config/ kstarsrc file to determine where the image will be centered, and how it is rendered. This means you need to run & kstars; in normal GUI mode, and exit the program when it is set up with the desired options for the generated images. This is not very flexible, so we also provide the ability to execute a & kstars; DCOP script to set the scene before generating the image. The filename you specify as the script argument should be a valid & kstars; DCOP script, such as one created with the Script Builder Tool. The script can be used to set where the image is pointing, set the geographic location, set the time and date, change the Zoom level, and adjust other view options. Some of the DCOP functions make no sense in non-GUI mode (such as waitForKey()); if these functions are encountered while parsing the script, they are simply ignored.
