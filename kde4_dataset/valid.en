Here you can add extra extensions of audio files to be displayed in your Album view. Just write "mp7" to support files with the *. mp7 extension. Clicking on these files will play them in an embedded KDE audio player. You can also remove file formats that are supported by default by putting a minus sign in front of the extension: e. g. "-ogg" would remove all OGG files from your Album view and any trace of them in your database. They would not be deleted, just not shown in digiKam. Warning: Removing files from the database means losing all of their tags and ratings.

Already years ago experts were not able to differentiate a 256 kbps mp3 from the & CD; original and that was in a blind test with a HiFi system which you might never be able to effort. That still will reduce the storage space of the original wav by the factor of 5.5. On most modern systems you can as well use variable bit rate. Here the encoder varies the bit rate depending the complexity of the music according to its psychoacoustic model. The lame setting '--preset extreme 'generates a file with a VBR (variable bit rate in opposite to CBR, constant bit rate) of 224 to 256 kbps, depending the complexity of the music. This will compress the original by a factor up to 6.3 and will play on nearly everything currently on the market.

If you can use tone dialing, the amount of time it takes to dial can be changed using the S11 register. It gives the duration (in 100hundreds of a second) to send each tone while dialing. The default is usually 95 (almost a second.) How fast you can dial depends on the phone company's switching equipment which handles your line. The minimum duration is 50, almost twice as fast, and that speed often works.

In many aspects, a comfortable way of Profiling is using & cachegrind; or & callgrind;, which are simulators using the runtime instrumentation framework & valgrind;. Because there is no need to access hardware counters (often difficult with today's & Linux; installations), and binaries to be profiled can be left unmodified, it is a good alternative to other profiling tools. The disadvantage of simulation - slowdown - can be reduced by doing the simulation on only the interesting program parts, and perhaps only on a few iterations of a loop. Without measurement/ simulation instrumentation, & valgrind; 's usage only has a slowdown factor in the range of 3 to 5. Also, when only the call graph and call counts are of interest, the cache simulator can be switched off.

A new (empty) & kformula; document looks like a small blue square. This square stands for the central idea of & kformula;. It represents an empty list. The idea of & kformula; is to have different elements arranged in lists. An element in this respect might be a single char or a root symbol or something like that. The lists are put together so that they form a formula. That is there are lists for indexes, lower and upper bounds and so on. And of course there is the main list, which we've already seen.

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.
You have to specify a valid region.
No subtree check This option disables subtree checking, which has mild security implications, but can improve reliability is some circumstances. If a subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the whole filesystem is not, then whenever a NFS request arrives, the server must check not only that the accessed file is in the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is called the subtree_check. In order to perform this check, the server must include some information about the location of the file in the "filehandle" that is given to the client. This can cause problems with accessing files that are renamed while a client has them open (though in many simple cases it will still work). subtree checking is also used to make sure that files inside directories to which only root has access can only be accessed if the filesystem is exported with no_root_squash (see below), even the file itself allows more general access. As a general guide, a home directory filesystem, which is normally exported at the root and may see lots of file renames, should be exported with subtree checking disabled. A filesystem which is mostly read-only, and at least does not see many file renames (e. g. / usr or / var) and for which subdirectories may be exported, should probably be exported with subtree checks enabled.

& lokalize; is extensible using scripts in several interpreted languages, including Python and JavaScript. Scripts are usually integrated into & lokalize; UI as menu actions (to which you may assign a keyboard shortcut). The location and name of menu entry for the script is defined in its accompanying. rc file. On each project open & lokalize; scans PROJECTDIR/ lokalize-scripts folder for. rc files and adds them to a cache file called PROJECTDIR/ lokalize-scripts/ scripts. rc (so you should n't generally want to add it project's version control system). RC files also contain script paths, which may be relative to. rc file folder, or to a system scripts folder - they are tried both (actually they should be relative if you want to share. rc file with other people in your project). So you for example can specify.. /.. / scripts/ lokalize/ opensrc. py to load script from global kde4-l10n scripts folder (ie; not specific to your language).

However, you might need to ask a search engine to find a suitable package of lame, as sometimes it is considered to be not totally free.

However, you are allowed to slide the tiles on the board, if the row or column where they are placed has some empty space. To make a sliding move, you have to click on the tile containing the column or row that can slide, and then on the matching tile. If there are two possible sliding moves, you will have to click on one of the two connecting lines to chose your preferred move.
