Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld, was detained by police in Spain, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, according to the Post.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly responsible for drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijas, Malaga province.
Three men were arrested on suspicion in Estonia, one of which is a leading figure in the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said the head of pre-trial proceedings in the case, said Mr Verte, a state prosecutor.
"We are not ruling out increasing the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with the Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Metropolitan Police Service, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the long-running work, we have continued to have convictions for crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that federal police officers were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who have been arrested may continue to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was found guilty of racketeering in 2005 by a district court in Tallinn and sentenced to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after then-world leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxidermy and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded monthly rookies from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court judgments that have come to terms confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association criminal case, who were ordered to receive a criminal offence of EUR 80,000, or a judgment against nine individuals in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov, which aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and committing crimes related to human trafficking in East Virginia and in southern Estonia.
Confirl-based criminal income there is around 71,500 euros.
What has been made in these criminal matters has been ensured by police officers exchanging information and prosecutors exchanging information and evidence with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, carrying out actions in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Midsugar, which runs until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-Americans, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state, taking into account the suspicious racial events that have occurred recently across the state."
The NAACP said the group urged both the recent Missouri law to issue a travel warning, making it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, and the fact that the state's law enforcement officers target minorities in an unequal way.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of the color of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
This is the first such warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of bench while driving through the state and was taken into custody by police in Missouri without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note cites a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black motorists are 75% more likely to stop cars than white people.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether that means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state at 16th place in the state's number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have been using the measure as a countervisor to certain intra-U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different - A, B, C, and E, hepatitis virus.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have chronic hepatitis, which can develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer, is a poor cost.
Mood Kutsar, epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, glandular urine, muscular and joint pain, and the collar of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name for liver inflammation, colloquial.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be determined on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Extreme hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-related disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and from hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouths and drug use.
The risk of hepatitis infection, or at-risk, family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high spread.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of vaccination for people travelling and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is important: wash or disinfect all fruit and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-dural, blood-thinning creatures (toothbrushes, squatting tools), donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-boy person, and from a hepatitis-stricken mother to foetal/born.
The injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and hole-in-the-wall, and the use of condoms in the event of infection-prone sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when a sick person's blood is exposed to, injected with drugs, tattooing, hole-in-dust, using blood-contaminated creatures, donor blood, having sex with hepatitis, and having hepatitis from mother to foetal/born.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, infected person sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and holeing, and the use of condoms in the event of infection-prone sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis.
Hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B or a superficial infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, their contaminated needles, sexually and from the rarely infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses are spread through fetal-oral teaspoon drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Preventive measures for hepatitis include hygiene compliance: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to sprint off the four-time Olympic champion in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with her after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I greatly miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in a row in London with a 5,000 and 10,000 metre run golden duo.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the origin story of one of the artworks from the birthplace of one of the arts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Vienna.
But even more in history.
The ensuing amount of information might have been worn out, a thinner subject that allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence on the extraordinary story.
There would be two books now on the same cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in her painting "Daam in Gold," and a much larger and comprehensive historical record of the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and who have themselves in the Austrian capital, can imagine, without the slightest effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where he was subjected to incurable syphilis and was the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to give nothing to the development of the story.
Or, perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten of Vienna's residents were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married her two-time Open Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't draw all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Damid in Gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
