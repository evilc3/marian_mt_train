Four members of the Kemerovo gang detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in Spain, was detained by police in Spain as Slava Kemerovsky, known in the criminal world.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society, aged 27 and 57, who are mainly responsible for drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijas, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of suspects in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said the head of pretrial proceedings in the criminal case, said Mr Verte, a state prosecutor.
"We are not ruling out that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," prosecutor Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the CCC, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the long-running work, we have recorded and we have arrested suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
The spokesman added that federal police officers were assisting in the arrests in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men on suspicion of being at large can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
Pre-trial proceedings are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was found guilty of extortion and sentenced to five years in prison by a district court in Tallinn.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxiderned taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest verdicts, eight defendants from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Community criminal case who were ordered to have seized EUR 80,000 in proceeds of criminal damage, or the judgment of nine individuals in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov, who set up a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and committing crimes related to human trafficking in East Virginia and the South in Estonia.
Confirl-protection income there is around 71,500 euros.
Success in these criminal matters has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day, and if necessary, operations will be carried out in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Mussuri, which runs until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-Americans, visitors and Missourians to be particularly vigilant and extremely careful as they move around the state, given the entire royals of suspicious racial events that have occurred recently across the state and are also listed here."
The NAACP said the group urged the travel warning to issue both the recent Missouri law, making it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and the fact that it is minorities who are targets for the unequally responsible state.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled onto the side of the road because of the colour of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued to the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note cites a recent report by the Missouri attorney general's attorney general, which shows that in the state, cars of black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than white people.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it's taking bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state for the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel briefings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Foreign Office for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain intra-U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different types - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which can continue to develop into cerebral cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer, is a poor-coloured cost.
Moody Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, plantation, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, faint excitement, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and the yellowing of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name of the liver inflammation, collar.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be identified based on data from laboratory studies.
Extreme hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-dammable disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from stools to hands and hands, surfaces, objects, mouth-watering and drug use.
Families and carers at risk of hepatitis infection, known as risk-averse disease, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of vaccination and being at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is important: wash or disinfect your hands before using all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-cheek, using blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, squatting tools), donor blood, having sex with hepatitis suspicious person, and having sex with a hepatitis mother to foetal/born.
The injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and carers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharpeners and syringes, tattooing and holeing, and using condoms in the event of infection-prone sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is a free part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-cheek, using blood-contaminated creatures, donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-related person, and from hepatitis to mother to foetus/born.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, infected person sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers, people with HIV infections, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringe-infections, tattooing and sniffing, and using condoms for infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B or a superficial infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through exposure to blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mothers to the foetus.
Hepatitis D is a risk group for chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses are spread through fetal-oral tea drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetuses.
Passengers may become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Preventing hepatitis is to meet hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Despite the rivals trying to get the four-time Olympic champion off the track in the final round, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I greatly miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row with a golden duo of the 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the origins of one artwork from the origin of the late 19th and early 20th-century Vienna cultural life.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information would have worn off perhaps a louder cut, a narrower subject allowed to have had more of an impact on the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title.
There would be two books on the cover at the moment: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in her painting "Daam in Gold," and a much larger and more comprehensive historical book about the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the sprawling Vienna cultural life in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and whoever has himself in the Austrian capital can imagine, without the slight effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than 100 years ago, or how everyone turned his head around Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar of cultures.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where he was immersed in incursive syphilis and was the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten of Vienna's residents was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open a Czech sugar magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't draw the whole glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Dami in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
